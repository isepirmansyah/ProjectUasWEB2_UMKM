                                        <p>As is the case with any new technology product, the cost of a Pocket PC
                                            was substantial during it’s early release. For approximately $700.00,
                                            consumers could purchase one of top-of-the-line Pocket PCs in 2003.

                                            reasonable now that the newness is wearing off. For approximately
                                            $350.00, a new Pocket PC can now be purchased.</p>

                                        <p>Polyester is deemed lower quality due to its none natural quality’s. Made
                                            from synthetic materials, not natural like wool. Polyester suits become
                                            creased easily and are known for not being breathable. Polyester suits
                                            tend to have a shine to them compared to wool and cotton suits, this can
                                            make the suit look cheap. The texture of velvet is luxurious and
                                            breathable. Velvet is a great choice for dinner party jacket and can be
                                            worn all year round.</p>
